Instructions
Create a project-2 repository on GitHub.

  "Project 2" (feel free to rename after you're finished).
In the <body>, add a <header>, <main>, and <footer>.
View this how-to on creating single-page navigation and setting anchors to sectionsLinks 
to an external site. on a page. Use it to create your page <nav>Links to an external site.
   in the <header>.
In <main> create 3+ sections (or articles or divs). Give each an id of "about", "facts", 
  and "contact".
Use at least 2 full images (absolute or relative URLs are fine) with src and alt.
In your "about" section, use a heading 1 and any other markup to introduce yourself and 
your page.
In the "facts" section, share a list of facts you've learned about web design. You can 
pull from your Exercise 2 to save time!
In your "contact" section, add a very simple contact form with a least an email input, 
textarea input, and submit button!
In the <footer>, add some contact information (your choice), such as a logo image, email 
  link or phone number, external links to social media, or copyright date. This can be 
  made up or placeholder material.

Experiment with styling images, by setting size, position, etc.
Experiment with adding backgrounds.
Experiment with styling text.
Deploy GitHub Pages. Save your changes and push them to GitHub.

              <h2>How are images added with HTML?</h2>
                <p>To be added into an HTML webpage images need their own tag . They are an empty element that provides, through the tag, a link to the image. If it is a local file, images are added with a link that doesn't have an https: file location, but just tells the browser to look within the files of the computer. However, if the image is on a website beyond just one's own computer, like a public website viewed by others, an absolute URL is required, including that https: format.</p> 
              
              <h2>What is required in an image element?</h2>
                <p>To add that link, there needs to be more than just the tag, a source attribute provides a place for a URL to be placed to link to the image. The tag brackets around the image path in quotes after the source attribute. The image element begins with its own beginning and ending brackets, and within that is the source that gives the specific path to the image src='' and can also include the alternative text that describes what the image shows alt='' . Width="" and height="" can also be added.
